## ISSUES WITH THIS THAT WOULD BE FIXED IN A REAL PROJECT:

1. Since this is a practice project, the authentication middleware is done using JWT. In a real application, this will be replaced with a more robust authentication library
2. The likes indexing is highly inefficient. In a real application, indexes will be created so that binary search can easily be implemented
3. In production, factory functions would be created to refactor the code.
4. All the route parameters are fucking ugly. This would be fixed.
5. The types for everything aren't perfect. This would be fixed in production.
